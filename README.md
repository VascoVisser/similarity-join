Trie-join
=========

This python package allows for joins between two sets of strings subject to a similarity constrain (edit distance). The algorithms implemented are inspired by [1].

Please refer to [my site](http://procrastinaty.com/projects/) for the documentation.

V0.1.1 adds support for self-joins
V0.1.0 only implements trie lookups
